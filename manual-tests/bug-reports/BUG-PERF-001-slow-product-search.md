- **Priority**: P2
- **Bug Type**: Performance
- **Component**: Search
- **Status**: Open

## Environment Information

- **Browser**: Chrome 120.0.6099.109

## Bug Description

### Summary

Product search functionality takes 5-8 seconds to return results for common search terms, significantly exceeding the acceptable response time of 2 seconds.

### Detailed Description

When users perform product searches using common terms like "laptop", "phone", or "shoes", the search results take an unacceptably long time to load. The search interface shows a loading spinner for 5-8 seconds before displaying results. This poor performance creates a frustrating user experience and may lead to users abandoning their search or leaving the site entirely.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the main website homepage
2. Click in the search bar at the top of the page
3. Type a common search term: "laptop"
4. Press Enter or click the search button
5. Start timer and observe loading time
6. Note when search results appear

## Expected Result

- Search results should appear within 2 seconds
- Loading indicator should be minimal
- Results should be relevant and properly formatted

## Actual Result

- Search results take 5-8 seconds to appear
- Extended loading spinner creates poor user experience
- Users may think the system is unresponsive

## Test Data Used

| Field                  | Value       | Notes                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Search Term            | "laptop"    | Common search term                |
| Expected Response Time | < 2 seconds | Performance requirement           |
| Actual Response Time   | 5-8 seconds | Measured across multiple attempts |
| Result Count           | 45 products | Reasonable result set size        |

## Reproducibility

- **Frequency**: Always
- **Reproducible**: Yes
- **Conditions**: Occurs consistently with various search terms

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact

- **User Impact**: All users performing product searches
- **Functional Impact**: Search functionality is slow and frustrating
- **Revenue Impact**: Slow search may reduce conversions and increase bounce rate

### Technical Impact

- **System Impact**: Search API performance is below acceptable standards
- **Data Impact**: No data corruption, but query performance issues
- **Integration Impact**: May indicate broader database performance problems
