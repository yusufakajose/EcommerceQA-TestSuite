## Bug Description

### Summary

Product search functionality is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing malicious scripts to be executed when reflected in search results.

### Detailed Description

The product search feature does not properly sanitize user input before displaying it in the search results page. When a user enters JavaScript code as a search term, the code is executed in the browser, creating a potential security vulnerability. This could allow attackers to steal user session data, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**⚠️ SECURITY ALERT: This is a critical security vulnerability that must be addressed immediately.**

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the product search page
2. Enter the following payload in the search box: `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script>`
3. Press Enter or click the search button
4. Observe that the JavaScript alert executes

## Expected Result

- Search input should be properly sanitized
- No JavaScript code should execute
- Search term should be displayed as plain text only
- No security vulnerabilities should be present

## Actual Result

- JavaScript alert box appears with "XSS Vulnerability" message
- Malicious script executes in the user's browser
- Search input is not properly sanitized before display

## Test Data Used

| Field               | Value                              | Notes           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| XSS Payload         | `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`    | Basic XSS test  |
| Alternative Payload | `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` | Image-based XSS |
| URL Payload         | `javascript:alert('XSS')`          | URL-based XSS   |

## Reproducibility

- **Frequency**: Always
- **Reproducible**: Yes
- **Conditions**: Occurs with any JavaScript payload in search input

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact

- **User Impact**: All users are potentially vulnerable to XSS attacks
- **Functional Impact**: Security breach could compromise user data and trust
- **Revenue Impact**: Security incidents could lead to significant business damage

### Technical Impact

- **System Impact**: Critical security vulnerability affecting user safety
- **Data Impact**: Potential for session hijacking and data theft
- **Integration Impact**: May indicate broader input validation issues

## Attachments
