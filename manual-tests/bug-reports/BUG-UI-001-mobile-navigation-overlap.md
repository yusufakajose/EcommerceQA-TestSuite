- **Operating System**: Android 13

## Bug Description

### Summary

On mobile devices with small screens (≤360px width), the hamburger navigation menu overlaps the main page content when opened, making it difficult to read and interact with both the menu and the content.

### Detailed Description

When users open the mobile navigation menu on devices with screen widths of 360px or smaller, the menu drawer does not properly overlay or push the main content. Instead, it partially overlaps the content, creating a confusing user experience where both the menu items and page content are visible simultaneously. This makes it difficult for users to navigate the site effectively on smaller mobile devices.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the website on a mobile device or browser with viewport width ≤360px
2. Navigate to any page (home, product catalog, etc.)
3. Tap the hamburger menu icon (☰) in the top navigation
4. Observe the menu behavior and content visibility

## Expected Result

- Navigation menu should either:
  - Completely overlay the main content with a backdrop, OR
  - Push the main content to the side (slide-out behavior)
- Main content should not be visible/accessible while menu is open
- Menu should be fully readable and interactive

## Actual Result

- Navigation menu opens but only partially covers the main content
- Main page content remains visible and partially accessible
- Menu items overlap with page content, creating visual confusion
- Some menu items may be difficult to tap due to content interference

## Test Data Used

| Page Content | Product catalog    | Any page content        |

## Reproducibility

- **Frequency**: Always
- **Reproducible**: Yes
- **Conditions**: Occurs on screen widths ≤360px consistently
