## Bug Classification Guidelines

### Severity Definitions

#### Critical

- System crashes or becomes completely unusable
- Data loss or corruption occurs
- Security vulnerabilities that expose user data
- Payment processing completely fails
- Core functionality is completely broken

#### High

- Major features don't work as expected
- Significant user experience degradation
- Authentication or authorization failures
- Incorrect calculations affecting business logic
- Performance issues that severely impact usability

#### Medium

- Minor feature issues that don't block core functionality
- UI/UX issues that affect experience but don't prevent completion
- Performance issues that are noticeable but not blocking
- Cosmetic issues in important user-facing areas

#### Low

- Minor cosmetic issues
- Spelling or grammar errors
- Minor UI alignment problems
- Enhancement requests
- Issues in rarely used features

### Priority Definitions

#### P1 (Critical)

- Must be fixed immediately
- Blocks production deployment
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data corruption issues

#### P2 (High)

- Should be fixed in current release
- Affects core user workflows
- Performance issues
- Major functional problems

#### P3 (Medium)

- Should be fixed when resources allow
- Minor functional issues
- UI/UX improvements
- Non-critical performance issues

#### P4 (Low)

- Nice to have fixes
- Cosmetic improvements
- Enhancement requests
- Documentation updates

## Bug Lifecycle

### Status Definitions

1. **Open**: Bug has been reported and is awaiting assignment
2. **In Progress**: Bug is being actively worked on by assigned developer
3. **Resolved**: Fix has been implemented and is ready for testing
4. **Closed**: Bug has been verified as fixed and testing is complete
5. **Reopened**: Bug was closed but issue persists or has regressed
6. **Deferred**: Bug will be addressed in a future release
7. **Won't Fix**: Bug will not be addressed (by design, obsolete, etc.)
8. **Duplicate**: Bug is a duplicate of another reported issue
9. **Cannot Reproduce**: Unable to reproduce the reported issue

### Bug Workflow

```
Open → In Progress → Resolved → Closed
  ↓         ↓           ↓         ↓
Deferred  Won't Fix   Reopened   ↓
  ↓         ↓           ↓         ↓
Closed    Closed      In Progress → ...
```

## Bug Metrics and KPIs

### Key Performance Indicators

#### Bug Discovery Rate

- Bugs found per testing day
- Bugs found per test case executed
- Bugs found by severity level

#### Bug Resolution Time

- Average time from Open to Resolved
- Average time from Resolved to Closed
- Time to resolution by severity level

#### Bug Quality Metrics

- Percentage of bugs reopened
- Percentage of duplicate bugs reported
- Percentage of "Cannot Reproduce" bugs

#### Test Effectiveness

- Bugs found in testing vs production
- Bug escape rate to production
- Cost of bugs found in different phases

### Current Metrics (Week 1)

- **Total Bugs Reported**: 5
- **Critical Bugs**: 1 (requires immediate attention)
- **Average Reporting Quality**: High (all bugs include required information)
- **Bug Discovery Rate**: 5 bugs per day (initial testing phase)

## Bug Triage Process

### Daily Bug Triage

1. **Review New Bugs**: Assess all newly reported bugs
2. **Validate Severity/Priority**: Confirm appropriate classification
3. **Assign Ownership**: Assign to appropriate development team
4. **Set Target Resolution**: Establish timeline based on priority
5. **Update Stakeholders**: Communicate critical issues immediately

### Weekly Bug Review

1. **Status Updates**: Review progress on all open bugs
2. **Escalation**: Escalate overdue or blocked bugs
3. **Metrics Review**: Analyze bug trends and patterns
4. **Process Improvement**: Identify areas for improvement

## Escalation Procedures

### Immediate Escalation (Critical/P1)

- **Security vulnerabilities**: Immediate escalation to Security Team and Management
- **Data corruption**: Immediate escalation to Database Team and Management
- **System crashes**: Immediate escalation to Infrastructure Team

### Standard Escalation (High/P2)

- **Overdue by 2 days**: Escalate to Development Lead
- **Blocking testing**: Escalate to Project Manager
- **Customer impact**: Escalate to Product Owner

### Communication Channels

- **Slack**: #bug-reports channel for daily updates
- **Email**: Weekly bug summary to stakeholders
- **Dashboard**: Real-time bug status dashboard
- **Meetings**: Daily standup bug status updates

## Bug Prevention Strategies

### Proactive Measures

1. **Code Reviews**: Mandatory peer reviews before deployment
2. **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suite execution
3. **Static Analysis**: Code quality and security scanning
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance tracking

### Process Improvements

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Analyze patterns in bug reports
2. **Training**: Developer training on common bug patterns
3. **Documentation**: Maintain coding standards and best practices
4. **Feedback Loops**: Regular retrospectives on bug trends
