2. **Stakeholder Confirmation**: Relevant stakeholders confirm readiness
3. **Documentation**: Entry criteria validation is documented
4. **Go/No-Go Decision**: Formal decision to proceed with testing phase

### Exit Criteria Validation

1. **Metrics Review**: Test metrics are analyzed against exit criteria
2. **Defect Analysis**: Defect status is reviewed and approved
3. **Stakeholder Approval**: Stakeholders approve testing completion
4. **Sign-off**: Formal sign-off on testing phase completion

## Exception Handling

### Entry Criteria Exceptions

If entry criteria cannot be fully met:

1. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate risks of proceeding without meeting criteria

2. **Risk Acceptance**: Stakeholders must formally accept risks
3. **Mitigation Plan**: Plan for addressing issues post-release
4. **Conditional Release**: Define conditions for release approval

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Entry Criteria Monitoring
