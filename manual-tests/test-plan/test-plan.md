## Introduction

### Purpose
This test plan outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the e-commerce web application. The plan defines the testing scope, objectives, approach, resources, and schedule for ensuring the application meets quality standards and business requirements.

### Application Overview
The e-commerce application is a modern web-based platform built with:
- **Frontend**: React.js with responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API
- **Database**: MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Payment**: Integrated payment gateway
- **Hosting**: Cloud-based deployment

### Key Features to Test
- User registration and authentication
- Product catalog browsing and search
- Shopping cart functionality
- Checkout and payment processing
- User profile management
- Order history and tracking
- Admin panel (if applicable)

## Test Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Functional Validation**: Ensure all features work according to specifications
2. **User Experience**: Validate intuitive and seamless user interactions
3. **Performance**: Verify acceptable response times and system performance
4. **Security**: Ensure data protection and secure transactions
5. **Compatibility**: Confirm cross-browser and cross-device functionality
6. **Reliability**: Validate system stability under normal and stress conditions

### Success Criteria
- 100% of critical test cases pass
- 95% of high-priority test cases pass
- 90% of medium-priority test cases pass
- No critical or high-severity defects remain open
- Performance benchmarks are met
- Security vulnerabilities are addressed

## Scope

### In Scope
#### Functional Testing
- User registration, login, and authentication
- Product catalog browsing and search functionality
- Shopping cart operations (add, update, remove items)
- Checkout process and payment integration
- User profile management
- Order history and tracking
- Email notifications and confirmations

#### Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing, stress testing, response time validation
- **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, data validation, XSS prevention
- **Usability Testing**: User interface, navigation, accessibility compliance
- **Compatibility Testing**: Cross-browser, cross-device, responsive design
- **API Testing**: REST API endpoints, data validation, error handling

#### Test Types
- **Manual Testing**: Exploratory testing, user acceptance testing
- **Automated Testing**: Regression testing, smoke testing, API testing
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing with JMeter
- **Security Testing**: Basic vulnerability assessment

### Out of Scope
- Third-party payment gateway internal testing
- Email server configuration testing
- Infrastructure and server configuration testing
- Database administration and backup procedures
- Content management system testing (if separate)

## Test Strategy

### Testing Approach
The testing approach follows a risk-based strategy focusing on critical business functions and user journeys.

#### Test Levels
1. **Unit Testing**: Developer responsibility (not covered in this plan)
2. **Integration Testing**: API and component integration testing
3. **System Testing**: End-to-end functionality testing
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Business requirement validation

#### Test Types by Priority
1. **Critical Path Testing**: Core user journeys (registration → browse → purchase)
2. **Feature Testing**: Individual feature validation
3. **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality remains intact
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios

### Test Execution Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Smoke testing and critical path validation
- **Phase 2**: Comprehensive functional testing
- **Phase 3**: Non-functional testing (performance, security, compatibility)
- **Phase 4**: User acceptance testing and final validation

## Test Environment

### Environment Requirements
