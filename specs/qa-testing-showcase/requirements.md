# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project creates a comprehensive QA testing suite for a sample e-commerce web application built with React frontend and Node.js/Express backend. The project will include manual testing documentation, automated test scripts, bug reporting, and test case management to demonstrate professional QA testing practices. The testing will target a modern web application with REST APIs, responsive design, and standard e-commerce functionality including user registration, product browsing, shopping cart, and checkout processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a QA tester, I want to create comprehensive manual test cases, so that I can systematically validate all application functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating test documentation THEN the system SHALL provide at least 50 detailed manual test cases covering positive, negative, and edge case scenarios
2. WHEN structuring test cases THEN each test case SHALL include preconditions, test steps, expected results, and priority levels
3. WHEN defining test coverage THEN the test cases SHALL cover user registration, login, product search, cart functionality, and checkout processes
4. WHEN organizing tests THEN test cases SHALL be categorized by functional area and organized in a clear hierarchy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a QA tester, I want to implement automated test scripts, so that I can efficiently execute repetitive tests and validate system functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing automation THEN the system SHALL include at least 20 automated test scripts using industry-standard tools
2. WHEN creating automated tests THEN tests SHALL cover UI automation, API testing, and basic performance testing
3. WHEN selecting testing tools THEN the project SHALL use Playwright for UI automation, Postman/Newman for API testing, and JMeter for performance testing
4. WHEN implementing test frameworks THEN the project SHALL use JavaScript/TypeScript with Playwright Test framework for test execution and reporting
5. WHEN managing test data THEN tests SHALL use JSON fixtures and CSV files for data-driven testing scenarios
6. WHEN setting up execution THEN automated tests SHALL be executable with clear setup and run instructions using npm scripts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a QA tester, I want to document bugs professionally, so that development teams can understand and resolve issues efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting bugs THEN the system SHALL include at least 15 detailed bug reports with proper formatting
2. WHEN creating bug reports THEN each report SHALL include title, description, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual results, severity, and screenshots
3. WHEN categorizing bugs THEN bugs SHALL be classified by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and type (Functional, UI, Performance, Security)
4. WHEN writing reports THEN bug reports SHALL use clear, professional language suitable for development teams

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a QA tester, I want to create comprehensive test planning documentation, so that testing activities are well-organized and systematic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning tests THEN the system SHALL include a comprehensive test plan document outlining scope, approach, and timeline
2. WHEN tracking coverage THEN the plan SHALL include a traceability matrix linking requirements to test cases
3. WHEN assessing risks THEN the test plan SHALL identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
4. WHEN defining criteria THEN the documentation SHALL include test environment requirements and entry/exit criteria

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a QA tester, I want to demonstrate various testing types, so that I can validate different aspects of application quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing testing THEN the project SHALL demonstrate functional, usability, compatibility, and security testing
2. WHEN testing mobile compatibility THEN the project SHALL include responsive design testing across different devices
3. WHEN checking accessibility THEN tests SHALL include basic WCAG compliance validation
4. WHEN evaluating performance THEN the project SHALL include JMeter test plans for load testing scenarios and results analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a QA tester, I want to create professional test reports, so that stakeholders can understand testing outcomes and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reporting results THEN the system SHALL include executive summary reports with key metrics and findings
2. WHEN formatting documentation THEN all deliverables SHALL be professionally formatted with consistent styling
3. WHEN presenting findings THEN the project SHALL include visual elements like charts, graphs, and screenshots
4. WHEN providing instructions THEN the project SHALL include a comprehensive README with setup and execution guidance
